**TOGGLE MAX 3 BUTTONS**

The application has seven buttons next to each other called "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F" and "G".

At any time, a maximum of three buttons can be "on" and the rest of the buttons must be "off". It is always possible, of course, for less than three buttons to be "on".

When the user presses a button, that button gets toggled:

if it is "on" it becomes "off"
if it is "off" it becomes "on", but only if making it "on" does not result in more than the maximum number of buttons (3) being "on"! If making it on would result in more than three buttons being "on" then the button stays "off".
The buttons that are "on" have a background color of blue. The buttons that are "off" have a backgound color of gray.

Initially, all the buttons are "off".
