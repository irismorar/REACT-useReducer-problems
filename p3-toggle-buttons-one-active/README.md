**TOGGLE BUTTONS - ONLY ONE ACTIVE**

The application has three buttons next to each other called "left", "center" and "right".

At any time, only one of the buttons can be "on". When the user presses a button, that button becomes toggled "on" and the other buttons get toggled "off".

The button that is "on" has a background color of blue. The buttons that are "off" have a backgound color of gray.

Initially, button "A" is "on" and the other two are "off".

Note
To make it easier to envision this, think of the buttons in a Word document that you press to decide how the text is aligned - left, right, or center; it's the same basic functionality, i.e. only one can be active at any time.
