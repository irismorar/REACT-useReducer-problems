**TOGGLE ANY NUMBER OF BUTTONS**

The application has five buttons next to each other called "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E".

At any time, any number of buttons can be "on" or "off", no restrictions.

When the user presses a button, that button gets toggled - if it is "on" it becomes "off" and vice-versa.

The buttons that are "on" have a background color of blue. The buttons that are "off" have a backgound color of gray.

Initially, all the buttons are "off".
